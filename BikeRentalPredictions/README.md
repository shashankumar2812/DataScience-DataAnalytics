# Bike Rental Predictions

Many American cities have communal bike sharing stations where you can rent bicycles by the hour or day. Washington, D.C. is one of these cities. The District collects detailed data on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day.

Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto compiled this data into a CSV file, which I will use in this project. The file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day.
